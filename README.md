# About

Data Agency is an interactive experience that exposes the lucrative world of data brokers. Our data is bought, analysed and sold in a multi-billion-dollar industry that remains unregulated and in the shadows. In Data Agency, through exploring how data brokerages operate and the ways in which they deal with our personal information, the trade-offs between ethics and profits are revealed to the player. You assume the role of a data broker, starting out as a fresh-faced intern and work your way to the top. How you handle the data will determine your journey. Will your actions have unintended consequences?
